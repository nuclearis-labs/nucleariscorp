      are used in SIEMENS-KWU nuclear power plants, and they are metallic seals covered 
      in electrolytic silver functioning as sealing of the cooling channels where uranium 
      fuel elements are. These rings seal the pressure vessel in hundreds of cooling channels inside
      the primary circuit of the reactor, where the heavy water circulates at 570°F of 
      temperature and 120 Atm of pressure.</p><p class="mb-2">NUCLEARIS designed and built a machine 
      that automates the electroplating process of these critical parts.</p><p class="mb-2">This is the most 
      important process in Seal Rings manufacturing because sealing capability depends upon the 
      resistance and adhesion of the Silver covering. These rings must resist inside the reactor 
      for a whole year and are subject to a heavy neutronic radiation environment. The covering is 
      a coat of 99.99% of pure Silver of 80 microns.</p><p class="mb-2">NUCLEARIS made a high technological 
      solution for a process that was made manually in Germany for many decades.</p>`,

      operational safety system to reduce maneuvering of the bridge handling burned uranium fuels.</p> 
      <p class="mb-2">The decay pools have demineralized water that cools down the spent fuels and acts as a biological shield for radiation.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">This development is an anti-collision System to prevent different objects handled underwater collide 
      with other existing objects inside the pool. NUCLEARIS adapted the old mechanic system and outfitted it 
      with the latest digital sensors and digital encoders in an automated system that restricts the bridge 
      movement in its three axes, allowing it to only move within a determined space called “virtual volume” 
      which is smaller than the pool’s volume. In case an object reaches the geometric limit of such “virtual volume” 
      the system will automatically prevent the bridge maneuvers.</p>
      <p>NUCLEARIS has developed an intelligent system with pre-loaded information related to the geometry of 
      thousands of objects inside the decay pools. Moreover, it can detect which type of objects or elements 
      are pending from the bridge. This system eliminates the risk of colliding a spent fuel element against 
      other submerged elements, the pool walls, or the floors.</p>`,

      This machine is in charge of extracting spent uranium fuel elements and introducing new ones inside 
      the vessel of the NPP.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">These rotating discs are part of the so-called encoders, which convert an electrical signal into linear 
      position information. Modern Optical Encoders cannot be used inside a nuclear reactor because the electronic 
      micro components do not resist neutron radiation, thus, electromechanical encoders must be used instead. 
      These encoders use several metallic brushes that function as “electrical contacts” that slide on the “stepped” 
      disc. This way the brushes conduct electrical signals through the metal areas, while they do not conduct 
      electricity through the areas where the plastic resin is located.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">The first part of the development consisted of machining the martensitic stainless steel discs by EDM and 
      then adding a plastic resin to generate the areas without electrical conductivity.</p>
      <p>After the machining process, NUCLEARIS developed the Gold Electroplating (24klts) process over the encoder 
      disc. The Gold covering over the disc must be of high precision to assure correct positioning of the refueling 
      machine inside the reactor building.</p>`,

      <p class="mb-2">One of them is called Seal Insert and consists of a steel ring covered with an electrolytic layer of 24

      <p class="mb-2">NUCLEARIS has specially developed a machine for gold and nickel covering for CANDU components.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">For this development, NUCLEARIS implemented the use of a FANUC robot with 6 degrees of freedom, which 
      provides maximum versatility, reliability, and speed in the production process. For the electrolytic 
      tanks, we have created independent units made of polypropylene and equipped them with a high-efficiency 
      recirculation and filtering system.</p>
