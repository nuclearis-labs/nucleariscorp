NUCLEARIS has developed various mechanical components that have been discontinued by the original manufacturers, in Germany.</p>\n      <p class=\"mb-2\">In this case, we have reverse-engineered a valve from the heavy water primary circuit and manufactured prototypes to test in a mock-up until we obtained a final qualification according to the technical requirements of the plant.</p>\n      <p class=\"mb-2\">All parts were produced by our machining partners under ISO9001. Additionally, the various mechanical parts were assembled by TIG welding at NUCLEARIS using the procedures approved by the Nuclear Power Plant.</p>\n      <p class=\"mb-2\">Today, NUCLEARIS is the only supplier qualified to manufacture this class 1 component (Component for the nuclear island in an NPP)</p>`,\n  },\n]\n\nexport default worksContent\n","import React, { ReactElement, useState } from \"react\"\nimport Header from \"../components/header\"\nimport Footer from \"../components/footer\"\nimport Seo from \"../components/seo\"\nimport { graphql } from \"gatsby\"\nimport worksContent from \"../content/works.js\"\nimport { StaticImage } from \"gatsby-plugin-image\"\n\ninterface Props {\n  data: any\n}\n\ntype Work = {\n  id: string\n  title: string\n  shortText: string\n  overlayText: string\n  fullText: string\n}\n\nfunction Works(_props: Props): ReactElement {\n  console.log(_props);\n  const [expandedWork, setExpandedWork] = useState<Work | null>(null)\n  const [workSlide, setWorkSlide] = useState(1)\n  const [showAllText, setShowAllText] = useState(false)\n\n  const compressWork = () => {\n    setExpandedWork(null)\n    setWorkSlide(1)\n    setShowAllText(false)\n  }\n\n  const changeWorkSlide = (direction: string) => {\n    if (expandedWork) {\n      const worksSlidesLength = _props.data[expandedWork.id].edges.length - 1\n      if (direction === \"previous\") {\n        if (workSlide === 1) {\n          setWorkSlide(worksSlidesLength)\n        } else {\n          setWorkSlide(workSlide - 1)\n        }\n      } else if (direction === \"next\") {\n        if (workSlide === worksSlidesLength) {\n          setWorkSlide(1)\n        } else {\n          setWorkSlide(workSlide + 1)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Seo/>\n      <Header isLanding={false} />\n      <div className=\"w-full max-w-5xl m-auto py-20 px-8\">\n        <div className=\"grid grid-cols-12\">\n          <h1 className=\"font-bold col-span-4 text-3xl mb-7 text-gable tracking-wide\">\n            Our Work\n          </h1>\n          {expandedWork && (\n            <div className=\"text-right col-span-8\">\n              <h1 className=\"hidden sm:inline-block font-normal text-base sm:text-2xl mt-2 text-gable tracking-wide\">\n                {expandedWork.title}\n              </h1>\n              <button\n                className=\"inline-block pt-3 sm:pt-0 sm:ml-4 opacity-50 hover:opacity-100 focus:outline-none outline-none transition-all\"\n                onClick={() => compressWork()}\n              >\n                <StaticImage\n                  src=\"../images/close.svg\"\n                  alt=\"Close\"\n                  placeholder=\"none\"\n                  width={17}\n                />\n              </button>\n            </div>\n          )}\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"grid grid-cols-12\">\n          {expandedWork && (\n            <>\n            <div className=\"col-span-12 text-center relative\">\n              <img\n                className=\"w-full\"\n                src={\n                  _props.data[expandedWork.id].edges[workSlide].node\n                    .childImageSharp.fluid.srcWebp\n                }\n                alt={expandedWork.shortText}\n              />\n              <button\n                className={`${\n                  showAllText ?
